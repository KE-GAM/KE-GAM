# Wonkyu Lee 👋
**I build things. If it helps someone, even better. If it’s fun, that’s good too.**

## 🔥 Now
- Building in-house services, internal tools, and dashboards at Nota AI (private repos / company IP).
- I build the core fast, show it early, then polish it based on how people use it.
- Doing game dev as a serious hobby (small scope → playable → release)

## 🧠 Interests
- Internal workflow automation / operational efficiency
- Data-driven dashboards (metrics design, visualization, operations)
- LLM/agent-based productivity tools

## 🧭 Tracks
- 🏢 Work (Private): in-house services / internal tools / dashboards (company IP)
- 🎮 Game Dev: [Unity/stack]
- 🧪 Experiments: utilities, LLM/agent prototypes, random builds
